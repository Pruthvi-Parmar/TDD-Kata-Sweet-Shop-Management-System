When Writing Tests:
"Write a failing Jest test for [specific functionality].
The test should check [specific behavior].
Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert).
Use descriptive test names in the format: 'should [expected behavior] when [condition]'"
When Implementing Features:
"Implement the minimal code needed to make the failing test pass.
Focus only on making this specific test green.
Do not add extra features or handle edge cases not covered by the test."
When Refactoring:
"Refactor the [component/function] to improve [specific aspect].
Ensure all tests remain green.
Follow SOLID principles and maintain code readability."
For Database Operations:
"Create a database migration/schema for [entity].
Include proper constraints, indexes, and relationships.
Use TypeScript types that match the database schema."
